Larceny support
===============

* [GitHub](https://github.com/larcenists/larceny)
* [Documentation](http://larcenists.org/Documentation/Documentation0.99/index.html)

Caveats
-------

* .slfasl modtime check is too inaccurate: https://github.com/okuoku/yuni/issues/64

YuniFFI
-------

YuniFFI support is incomplete. 

* It seems `foreign-procedure-pointer` is undocumented
